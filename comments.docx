Hello,

This app's purpose is a tech test for job application.
I would like to share a couple of comments regarding decisions made in development with reviewers:
I tried to contact you via email asking some questions about the details of the application. I waited for an answer for 3 days, but it didn't arrive. 
As a result, I ended up in serious time constraints as well as in uncertainty about some functionality of the application.
In the end, I decided to leave functionality very barebones, it specifically only fulfills your acceptance criteria and I left out any kind of data validation.
I do realise that the application was only fixed after the deadline, but I hope that you will be understanding towards my predicament.
